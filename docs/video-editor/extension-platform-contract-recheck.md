# M15 Contract-Recheck Matrix

**Status:** Active (M15)
**Last updated:** 2026-06-20
**Scope:** Every prior milestone Done Criteria claim (M0–M14) rechecked against current `main` evidence.

---

## 1. Purpose

This matrix maps every Done Criteria claim from prior milestone briefs to concrete implementation evidence discoverable in the repository. Each row receives a **status** (`pass`, `gap`, `blocked`) and a **disposition** (`supported`, `deferred`, `unsupported`, `release-blocking`). Rows that cannot honestly pass are listed in the blocker section (§ 3).

**Status definitions:**
- **pass** — Evidence confirms the claim is implemented and testable.
- **gap** — Partial evidence exists but is incomplete or insufficient for M15 confidence.
- **blocked** — No credible evidence; the claim cannot be substantiated against current `main`.

**Disposition definitions:**
- **supported** — The behavior is V1-supported with evidence.
- **deferred** — The behavior is explicitly documented as deferred with absence-check or blocker evidence.
- **unsupported** — The behavior is not implemented and no plan exists for V1.
- **release-blocking** — The gap is serious enough to block a V1 release.

## 3. Blocker Section

The following gaps are significant enough to warrant explicit blocker documentation. They are classified as `release-blocking` only when the absence of evidence makes a supported-deferred-matrix claim impossible to verify.

### 3.1 Release-blocking gaps

| Blocker ID | Affected Rows | Description | Resolution Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| B-001 | M14-001 through M14-011 | M14 (Packaging, Loader, Manager) has the highest concentration of gaps. The extension manager UI, persistence, integrity validation, migration diagnostics, and dependency management are core to the installable-pack experience. If M14 is not complete, the V1 developer experience for installed packs is unproven. | Verify M14 implementation against Done Criteria; classify any missing pieces as deferred with absence checks |
| B-002 | M12-001, M12-002, M12-007 | The render planner is named as the canonical export blocker surface, but its full implementation against current `main` is not confirmed. Without it, export guard behavior relies on ad hoc checks rather than the planner. | Confirm planner implementation or document it as deferred with ad hoc guards as acceptable V1 behavior |
| B-003 | M11-005 through M11-012 | Live data bridge (M11) has infrastructure (canaries, integration tests) but frontend state coverage for permission/error/bake/steering/recording/session-panel is sparse in identified tests. | Fill frontend closure tests or classify missing states as deferred |

### 3.2 Deferred/unsupported gaps (not release-blocking)

| Blocker ID | Affected Rows | Description | Deferral Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| D-001 | M4-003, M4-004, M4-005 | Command registry tests for palette interaction, stale context, and unregister lifecycle are not identified as standalone test files. Types and infrastructure exist. | Command infrastructure is type-proven and used by examples; full palette integration tests are deferred without blocking V1 docs |
| D-002 | M6-007 through M6-012 | Asset metadata/search/enrichment/provenance frontend rendering tests are sparse. SDK types are well-defined. | Asset metadata infrastructure is type-proven; frontend rendering completeness is deferred |
| D-003 | M10-002 through M10-011 | Agent tool canaries exist but comprehensive frontend and failure-path tests are not identified. | Agent tools are proposal-backed and follow established patterns; V1 agent-tool surface can be documented as partial with deferred test coverage |
| D-004 | M12-004 through M12-013 | Process/sidecar/roundtrip tests are not identified. SDK vocabulary is defined. | Process/sidecar infrastructure is vocabulary-proven; execution tests are deferred |
| D-005 | M5-001, M5-008, M5-009, M5-012 | Provider isolation, registry canary, planner skeleton, and disable-dispose tests are partial. Infrastructure types exist. | Provider-scoped registry foundation is proven; edge-case tests are deferred |

### 3.3 Cross-cutting structural notes

- **M11–M14 concentration:** The later milestones (live data, render planning, shaders, packaging) show progressively more gaps in identified evidence. This is partially expected — the epic builds incrementally and M15's purpose is to harden this evidence. The matrix treats gaps honestly; the supported/deferred matrix (T4) will classify these dispositions explicitly.
- **Test identification limitations:** Many tests exist in the repo but were not exhaustively indexed. Rows marked `gap` based on missing test evidence should be re-evaluated when the full test suite is run. The matrix uses "not identified" rather than "absent" for rows where dedicated tests may exist under non-obvious paths.
- **M0–M3 are the strongest:** The foundational milestones (scaffold, kernel, surfaces, timeline-patch) have the most robust evidence correlation, as expected for the core platform.
