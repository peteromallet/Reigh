-- 20260513120100_cleanup_and_capabilities.sql
--
-- Phase A Step 4 (T5) of brief "stop the cross-boundary contract bleeding".
--
-- Triage migration. Runs after 20260513120000_derive_route_key.sql (which
-- defined public.derive_route_key) and BEFORE the Layer-1 trigger migration
-- 20260513120200_tasks_claimable_trigger.sql. Goal: leave the tasks table
-- in a state where the trigger cannot reject any pre-existing row when it
-- attaches.
--
-- Pre-migration audit (T2.2) against live production captured the following
-- (all of which this migration must remain idempotent against):
--   * Hannah's 7-task chain (parent 0168dcc3-… + 6 children) is already
--     status='Failed'. UPDATEs below preserve that and stamp an
--     error_message if any row was Failed without one.
--   * route_backend_capabilities already has vibecomfy rows for both
--     qwen_image_style and animate_character (supports_route=t, enabled=t).
--     The INSERTs below use ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING so a re-run on a fresh
--     dev DB seeds them, while production is unaffected.
--   * No tasks match the ~40-row stuck cohort
--     (status='Queued' AND (selector_namespace IS NULL OR ='production')
--      AND route_key IS NULL). The UPDATEs below are defensive no-ops in
--     production but will heal the cohort if it reappears between now and
--     deploy.
--
-- The tasks.status enum is named public.task_status. error_message is the
-- canonical failure column (verified via information_schema.columns).

--    Production already has vibecomfy rows for both; ON CONFLICT keeps the
--    migration idempotent and ensures a fresh DB or a partially-seeded env
--    converges on the same baseline. The Layer-1 trigger in 120200 calls
--    route_backend_claim_decision, which returns eligible=false with
--    reason='missing_capability' if these rows are absent — by inserting
--    them here we keep the trigger from rejecting valid task_types.

-- 5. Post-condition asserts. Fail the migration loudly if Hannah's chain
--    or the capability rows didn't land. The backfill/stuck-fail steps
--    are defensive against the empty-cohort case so we don't assert on
--    them here.

-- Rollback notes (manual; this migration is data-only triage):
--   Hannah's chain stays Failed — by design, do NOT revive.
--   To roll back the capability inserts on a non-prod DB where they were
--   freshly seeded by this migration:
--     DELETE FROM public.route_backend_capabilities
--       WHERE route_key IN ('qwen_image_style','animate_character')
--         AND backend = 'vibecomfy';
--   Backfill UPDATEs are not reversible without a backup (the prior NULL
--   route_key state was already broken). The 24h-old stuck → Failed UPDATE
--   is similarly not reversible; affected rows were terminally unclaimable.
