# Local Development Setup

This guide provides the essential steps to set up and run this project locally using a SQLite database.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.
- Git installed.

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```sh
    # Replace <YOUR_GIT_URL> with the actual Git URL from GitHub
    git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
    cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm i
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment for Local SQLite:**
    *   Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project.
    *   Add the following line to it:
        ```env
        APP_ENV=local
        ```
    This configures the application to use a local SQLite database (defaulting to `./local.db`).

4.  **Set Up and Seed the Local SQLite Database:**
    Run the following command in your terminal:
    ```sh
    npm run db:seed:sqlite
    ```
    This command will:
    *   Create the `./local.db` file if it doesn't exist.
    *   Create all necessary tables based on the schema defined in `db/migrations-sqlite/0000_manual_initial_schema.sql`.
    *   Populate the database with initial seed data.
    *   You should see a confirmation message like `[Seed] Database seeding completed successfully.` in your terminal.

5.  **Start the Development Servers:**

    You'll need to run two separate commands in two different terminal sessions:

    *   **Frontend Development Server (Vite):**
        ```sh
        npm run dev
        ```
        Your application frontend should now be running (typically at `http://localhost:2222/`).

    *   **Backend API Server (Express.js):**
        ```sh
        npm run start:api
        ```
        This will start your backend server. Check your terminal output for messages indicating the server is running (e.g., listening on a specific port, typically different from the frontend).

    The frontend server will connect to the local SQLite database via the backend API server. Check your frontend terminal output for a message similar to `[DB] Connecting to SQLite at ./local.db via Drizzle...` (this message might appear when the backend server starts, or when the frontend first tries to communicate with it).

Your local development environment is now ready. You can access the application in your browser and begin working.
