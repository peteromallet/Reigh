# Feature Implementation & Refinements Summary

This document outlines the series of changes implemented based on the `plan.md` and subsequent user requests for the "Shots Pane" feature.

## 1. Initial Setup & Core Backend (`hooks/useShots.ts`)

-   **Database Schema**: User confirmed `shots` and `shot_images` tables were created in Supabase as per `plan.md` and `supabase/migrations/20240729000000_create_shots_tables.sql`.
-   **Type Definitions (`types/shots.ts`)**:
    -   Created `Shot`, `ShotImage`, and a placeholder `GenerationRow` interface.
    -   `GenerationRow` is used to define the structure of images within a shot.
-   **Supabase Types**: Generated TypeScript types from the Supabase schema using `supabase gen types typescript ... > src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`. This ensures type safety when interacting with the database.
-   **Core CRUD Hooks (`hooks/useShots.ts`)**:
    -   `useCreateShot(shotName)`: Creates a new shot group.
        -   Handles optimistic updates: adds a temporary shot to the cache, then invalidates on settle.
    -   `useListShots()`: Fetches all shots along with their associated images.
        -   Performs a join with `shot_images` and then `generations` to retrieve `generation_id` and `image_url` for each image within a shot (e.g., `shots(*, shot_images(generation_id, generations(id, image_url)))`).
        -   Transforms fetched data into the `Shot[]` structure, where each `Shot` includes an `images: GenerationRow[]` array.
        -   Images within each shot are sorted by their `position` field from the `shot_images` table.
    -   `useAddImageToShot({ shot_id, generation_id, imageUrl?, thumbUrl?, position? })`: Adds an existing image (by `generation_id`) to a shot.
        -   Handles optimistic updates: uses `imageUrl` and `thumbUrl` passed from the drag data to update the cache immediately.
    -   `useRemoveImageFromShot({ shot_id, generation_id })`: Removes an image from a shot.
    -   `useUpdateShotName({ shotId, newName })`: Updates the name of a shot.
        -   Handles optimistic updates.
    -   All mutation hooks utilize `@tanstack/react-query`'s `useMutation` and include `onMutate`, `onError`, and `onSettled` for robust optimistic updates and cache invalidation.

## 2. Shots Pane UI & Interaction (`components/`)

-   **`ShotsPane.tsx`**:
    -   Main container for the hover-activated shots drawer.
    -   Uses a 24px high "hot-zone" at the bottom of the viewport to trigger visibility.
    -   Pane slides up/down using CSS transitions (`translate-y-0` or `translate-y-full`).
    -   Hides automatically after a 300ms delay when the mouse leaves the pane or hot-zone.
    -   Fetches shot data using `useListShots()` and maps over it to render `ShotGroup` components.
    -   Renders `NewGroupDropZone`.
    -   This component is rendered within `src/pages/Index.tsx`.
-   **`ShotGroup.tsx`**:
    -   Displays a single shot group, including its name and a preview of its images.
    -   The shot name is editable via a double-click, which transforms the text into an input field. Changes are saved on blur or Enter key press using `useUpdateShotName`.
    -   Displays up to `MAX_THUMBNAILS` (currently 4) image thumbnails in a horizontal row. If more images exist, a "+N" indicator is shown.
    -   Acts as a droppable target for images.
-   **`NewGroupDropZone.tsx`**:
    -   A designated area within the `ShotsPane` for creating new shot groups by dropping an image onto it.
    -   Acts as a droppable target.

## 3. Drag and Drop Functionality (`@dnd-kit`)

-   **Dependencies**: Added `@dnd-kit/core` and `@dnd-kit/sortable` to project dependencies.
-   **Context Setup (`src/App.tsx`)**:
    -   `DndContext` wraps the main application routes within `AppContent`.
    -   Configured with `PointerSensor` (with an activation constraint of `distance: 8` to prevent accidental drags on click) and `KeyboardSensor`.
    -   The `handleDragEnd` function is defined here.
-   **Draggable Images (`src/components/ImageGallery.tsx` & `src/components/DraggableImage.tsx`)**:
    -   A new `DraggableImage.tsx` component was created, using `useDraggable` from `@dnd-kit/core`.
    -   It wraps each image card in `ImageGallery.tsx`.
    -   The drag payload includes `generationId`, `imageUrl`, `thumbUrl`, and the `sourceData` (the full image object).
    -   `onClick` handlers for buttons within the draggable image card have `e.stopPropagation()` to prevent them from interfering with drag operations.
-   **Droppable Targets**:
    -   `ShotGroup.tsx`: Uses `useDroppable` with `id: shot.id`.
    -   `NewGroupDropZone.tsx`: Uses `useDroppable` with a static ID (`NEW_GROUP_DROPPABLE_ID`).
-   **Drop Handling (`src/App.tsx` - `handleDragEnd` in `AppContent`)**:
    -   Determines if an item was dropped on an existing `ShotGroup` or the `NewGroupDropZone`.
    -   If on `ShotGroup`: Calls `addImageToShotMutation` with the target `shotId` and dragged image's `generationId`, `imageUrl`, and `thumbUrl`. Updates `lastAffectedShotId` state.
    -   If on `NewGroupDropZone`:
        -   Calculates a new shot name (e.g., "Shot X") based on the current number of shots (fetched via `useListShots` within `AppContent`).
        -   Calls `createShotMutation` to create the new shot.
        -   Calls `addImageToShotMutation` to add the dragged image to this new shot.
        -   Updates `lastAffectedShotId` state.
    -   Provides toast notifications for success/failure.
    -   Includes detailed console logging for drag events to aid debugging.

## 4. "Add to Last Shot" & Image Status in Gallery

-   **Last Affected Shot Context (`src/App.tsx`)**:
    -   A new React Context, `LastAffectedShotContext`, was created to share the ID of the shot that was most recently added to.
    -   The `App` component manages the `lastAffectedShotId` state and provides it and its setter through this context.
    -   `AppContent` updates this `lastAffectedShotId` in `handleDragEnd` after an image is successfully added to any shot.
-   **`src/pages/Index.tsx`**:
    -   Consumes `useLastAffectedShot` to get the `lastAffectedShotId`.
    -   Determines the `targetShotIdForButton` for the "Add to last shot" feature, prioritizing `lastAffectedShotId`, then falling back to the most recently created shot.
    -   Passes `targetShotIdForButton`, `lastShotNameForTooltip`, and `allShots` (from its own `useListShots` call) to `ImageGallery`.
    -   The `handleAddImageToTargetShot` function (passed as `onAddToLastShot`) uses `targetShotIdForButton` and calls `setLastAffectedShotId` on success.
-   **`src/components/ImageGallery.tsx`**:
    -   Accepts `allShots`, `lastShotId`, `lastShotNameForTooltip`, and `onAddToLastShot` props.
    -   Displays an "Add to last shot" button (using `PlusCircle` icon) in the top-left of each image card on hover.
        -   The button's tooltip dynamically shows the name of the target shot (e.g., "Add to: My Favorite Shot").
        -   The button is disabled if no `lastShotId` is available.
    -   Displays an indicator text (e.g., "In Shot X" or "In Y shots") below the "Add to last shot" button if the gallery image is already part of one or more shots. This is determined by checking the `image.id` against the `generation_id`s in the `allShots` data.

## 5. Default Shot Naming Convention

-   **Shot Name Generation (`src/App.tsx` - `handleDragEnd` in `AppContent`)**:
    -   When a new shot is created (by dropping an image on `NewGroupDropZone`), the name is now dynamically generated as "Shot X", where X is `currentShotCount + 1`.
    -   The `currentShotCount` is derived from the `shots` data fetched by `useListShots` within the `AppContent` component's scope.

## 6. Bug Fixes & Refinements

-   **QueryClientProvider Error**: Refactored `src/App.tsx` by creating an `AppContent` component. This ensures that hooks like `useCreateShot` (which internally use `useQueryClient`) are called within the `QueryClientProvider`'s scope, resolving the "No QueryClient set" error.
-   **Drag-and-Drop Interference with Clicks**: Adjusted the `PointerSensor` in `src/App.tsx` by setting an `activationConstraint: { distance: 8 }`. This requires the mouse to move a minimum distance before a drag is initiated, preventing accidental drags during clicks (e.g., opening a lightbox) and resolving a "duplicate key value violates unique constraint: shot_images_pkey" error that occurred when `handleDragEnd` was unintentionally triggered.
-   **Linter Errors & Type Safety**:
    -   Corrected various import paths across components.
    -   Refined type definitions and data transformations in `hooks/useShots.ts` (specifically in `useListShots`) to ensure data structures match expected types (e.g., `Shot[]` containing `GenerationRow[]`), resolving type errors when passing props.
    -   Updated `ImageGalleryProps` to include newly added props like `lastShotNameForTooltip`.
